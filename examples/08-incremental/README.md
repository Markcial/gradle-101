# 08 - Incremental builds

The most amazing feature of gradle, the incremental builds. With that feature, you will be able to create
some assets, then fetch some docs from a 3rd party library, pack certificates and finally create a single tar file with all the needed stuff for your deploy.

In this example I crafted something very simple a small js applications inside a golang process serving on a filesystem tcp server.
